# Slack Setbot

This repository is unaffiliated with Set or PlayMonster Group.

This Slack bot is built to record [daily Set](https://www.setgame.com/set/puzzle)
scores, to allow for Slack-wide competition.

## Configuration
A docker file is provided. Any non-docker setup will need to just follow the
steps from `Dockerfile` modified to your local environment.

Configuration for the app is done via ENV vars.

Required config for Slack connectivity
```
SLACK_VERIFICATION_TOKEN
SLACK_TEAM_ID
```

Optional config
```
DATABASE_URL
```
The database config defaults to a a SQLite3 file. Repo has only been tested with
SQLite3.

### Slack setup
Once you have the server up and running, a Slack app will need to be configured
and aimed at your server. There is currently no publicly available Slack app
built for this.

## Usage

Our Slack app is configured with the keyword `/set`, but this is an ambiguous
keyword, so you might pick something different. However, it will be used for
examples.

Commands are issued into Slack with `/set <command> <params>`
